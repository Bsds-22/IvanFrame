The most unfogetabble moment i have is that time whe there's this certain girl that i had a crush on, and i like her so much and because of that
i made a deal with her, im only at my first year highschool im still young and because of that i aggree to a deal that make me cold that i dont care
if someone will loved me again, she played me like im only just a toy for her, she laugh at me and now i regret that ive done that kind of thing and i cant even 
forget how stupid i am that time, love is truly blind. but now ill settle to a one girl that had a same vibe and also knows how to appreciate what i can do
and give.<p>
